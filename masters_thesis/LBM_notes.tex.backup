\author{Apaar Shanker}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document shall cover the basics of the theory pertaining to the application of lattice boltzmann model
to the simulation of fluid flow. We shall look into the numerical solutions - specifically a finite difference 
2 dimensional solver for simulating fluid flow in presence of a second solid phase with porous boundary.
