\section{Numerical methods}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Using the taylor series expansion work out an fourth order accurate in 
 space operator for $\dfrac{\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}$.
 \item For the classical diffusion equation, $\dfrac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D\dfrac{\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}$,
 write down how one would implement the periodic and no-flux boundary conditions in the explicit
 finite difference setting.
 \item In a small sketch highlight what would be the "actual boundary" where the boundary condition is applied.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item For the Allen-Cahn equation $\dfrac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} 
 = M\left(2\kappa \dfrac{\partial^{2}\eta}{\partial x^{2}} - \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial \eta}\right)$, write down
 the set of equations that you would derive for an implicit finite difference discretization for a 1*4 setting
 using the three-point stencil for the laplacian
 \item Work out the solution to this matrix, using the Thomas-Algorithm, with Dirichlet boundary conditions 
 for one time-iteration update.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cahn-Hilliard model}
\begin{itemize}
 \item For an equilibrium interface profile of a binary alloy, for the Cahn-Hilliard model discussed in class
 draw the following, a) the composition profile(mention the solution), b) ($\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial c}$),
 c) $f-\left(\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial c} - 2\kappa \nabla^{2}c\right)$, d) $(\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial c} - 2\kappa \nabla^{2}c\right)$.
 \item Write the equi-partition relation which gives the partial differential equation for the equilibrium interface.
 \item For the free-energy density of the form $f(c)=c^{2}\left(1-c^{2}\right)$, in terms of $\kappa$ write down the surface energy.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item If i were to tilt the free-enery wells of the function $f\left(c\right)=c^{2}\left(1-c^{2}\right)$ by a function
 $L\dfrac{\left(T-T_m\right)}{T_m}c$, will it cause the system to go out of equilibrium? Justify your answer.
 \item Assume, an appropriate tilting function, and compute how the region of compositions between which there
 is a immiscibility, changes as a function of temperature.
\end{itemize}

\section{Allen-Cahn model}
\begin{itemize}
 \item In the Allen-Cahn model discussed in class, prove that the value of the functional decreases montonically in time, using
 the evolution equation derived for the order parameter. Is it possible to model nucleation using such a deterministic evolution equation?
 \item If we were to choose a potential of the form $f\left(\eta\right)=\eta\left(1-\eta\right)$, in terms of $\kappa$, what would
 be the expression that derives you the surface energy. Is there something that needs to be done in "addition" to have stable evolution of
 the interface, given that there is no minima at $\eta=1$ and $\eta=0$.
 \item How does the condition of equilibrium differ from that of the Cahn-Hilliard equation?
\end{itemize}

\section{Phase-transformation:pure material solidification}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Draw the steady-state temperature profile across a 1D solid-liquid interface. What is Local thermodynamic equilibrium, 
 what does it imply with respect to the interface temperature. 
 \item Write down the evolution equation for the temperature field, and mark the source term and the diffusive flux.
 \item Expand the free energy of the solid and liquid until second order in temperature, and derive the driving force for
 solidification. Correspondingly derive the modified equation for temperature evolution. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Phase-transformation: binary alloy}

\begin{itemize}
 \item
