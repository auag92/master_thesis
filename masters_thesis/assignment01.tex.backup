\section{Numerical methods}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Using the taylor series expansion work out an fourth order accurate in 
 space operator for $\dfrac{\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}$.
 \item Utilizing this solve the simple diffusion equation in an \textit{explicit manner}:
 \begin{align}
  \dfrac{\partial c}{\partial t} &= D\dfrac{\partial^{2}c}{\partial x^{2}}
 \end{align}
 \item How many boundary points would you require in this discretization?
 \item Compare the solutions as functions of time with discretization used 
 in class that was second order in space.
 \item Write down the system of equations that you would require to solve in 
 a \textit{implicit} discretization.
 \item Solve the system of equations using a Jacobi/Gauss-siedel methods
 \item Again compare the solutions against those obtained with the explicit/implicit
 discretizations which are second order accurate.
 \item Can you think of a scheme of discretization which is second order accurate
 in space and time? Will the memory usage of this scheme be higher/lower compared
 to a simple Euler scheme?
\end{itemize}

\section{Cahn-Hilliard equation}
\begin{itemize}
 \item In the equations discussed in class, if the mobility (M) were a function of
 composition, how would you modify the discretization?
 \item Using this impose variable mobilities in the phases(different compositions)
 and see how the evolution of the compositions change with respect to equal 
 mobilities
 \item Add a temperature dependent term, to the free-energy $c^{2}\left(1-c^{2}\right)$ 
 in order to tilt the wells energetically. Does a linear function modify the equilibrium points 
 at all? Construct higher order functions which perform this tilting function.
 \item Can you device a scheme for measuring the velocities at the interface?
 \item Plot the variation of the velocities for different values of the temperature.
 \item Construct a different symmetric function and work out the equilibrium 
 profiles both numerically and analytically and compare them as was performed in the 
 class? What is the least order of the function that would give you phase separation?
\end{itemize}
